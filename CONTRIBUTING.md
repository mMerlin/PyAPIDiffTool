# Contributing to PyAPIDiffTool

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PyAPIDiffTool! We value your contributions and want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, create tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes. Once there is one. Create a start for one.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/mMerlin/PyAPIDiffTool/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Before reporting a bug, please [search the existing issues](https://github.com/mMerlin/PyAPIDiffTool/issues) to avoid duplicates. If you don't find a related issue, you can report a new bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mMerlin/PyAPIDiffTool/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. [This is a good example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- **Code Formatting**: Follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), which provides the foundation for writing readable and consistent Python code.
- **Docstrings and Comments**: Adhere to the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for writing meaningful docstrings and comments. This helps maintain documentation and improves code readability.
